Hey folks, Today i will talk about How Windows Logging Work

Let's Dive in!!

---------

First of all we should know the Importance of Understanding Log Collection.

we know that log collection is SIEM's duty but as an analyst that want to improve his capability you should know how your windows store these logs and how to see it real-time and how to read it...etc

1- improve your capability as an analyst not just an analyst who uses some tools without know the root about these tools.

2- Understanding logs is understanding the available tools. 

so let's get back to answer the question:

**Logs are records of events that happen in your computer, either by a person or by a running process. They help you track what happened and troubleshoot problems.**


## **Event Viewer**


The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the data are XML-formatted `.evtx` files

	- Note: File must be interpreted with tool
	- Cannot read directly like linux log text files

There are 3 main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:

1.  **Event Viewer**  (GUI-based application)
2.  **Wevtutil.exe**  (command-line tool)
3.  **Get-WinEvent**  (PowerShell cmdlet)

i will explain **Event Viewer** and **Get-WinEvent**, let's talk about event viewer first

we can open it using windows search and type event viewer or you can right-click on windows icon and select event viewer or we can use CLI and type `eventvwr.msc`

so after open event viewer we will see the following:

Event Viewer has an intuitive user interface. The main screen is divided into three sections:

-  The pane on the left provides a hierarchical tree listing of the event log providers and they called ( channels ).
-  The pane in the middle will either display a general overview and summary or the events specific to a selected channel.
-  The pane on the right is the actions pane.

## 1- Channels Pane



The Channels pane is where you choose the event log to view. By default, there are five channels of Windows logs More info [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/eventlog-key) :

-   Application – Information logged by applications hosted on the local machine.

-   Security – Information related to login attempts (success and failure), elevated privileges, and other audited events.

-   Setup – Messages generated when installing and upgrading the Windows operating system. If the Windows system is a domain controller, those messages are also logged here.

-   System – Messages generated by the Windows operating system.

-   Forwarded Events – Events forwarded by other computers when the local machine is functioning as a central subscriber.

There is also a section for Applications and Services Logs, including channels for Hardware Events, Internet Explorer and Windows PowerShell events, windows defender events..etc, you better take a look by yourself.

You can see PowerShell logging from

`Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational`

actually these channels are files they are `.evtx` files stored in your system you can try to read them by right-clicking on any channel then choose properties you will see all the details about the channel

**One other thing you should  know before dive into next pane**, What is the Windows Log Path?

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/vCvjKYl.png)

**From prev photo we noticed that there is something in the middle called Windows Event Log Service, this the service that  allowed the windows to record all your logs so if you want to know if it enabled or no you can check it by typing Services in windows search and navigate to windows event log and you should see the following**

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/eR178ir.png) 

if you noticed it is enabled by default and in the left the description of the service and what it does, 

after gets the data will filter the data based on their channels and we have discussed the channels... for example: found a logon attempt so it will put the log in the `security` channel because this channel is holding the logon attempts success and failure and so on... Let's Continue

## 2- Detail pane
There are 5 types of events that can be logged. Below is a table from [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-types) providing a brief description for each.

Each event has a type **Level**:

Focus your attention on the middle pane. Remember from earlier that this pane will display the events specific to a selected provider
In this case, **Security Channel**.

Windows logs are actually XML, but can be rendered differently.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mqzOOvW.png)


This section has 2 tabs:  **General**  and  **Details**.

-   General is the default view, and the rendered data is displayed.
-   The Details view has 2 options: Friendly view and  XML  view.

in XML view this what the log actually looks like, and if you want to see the real fields that your SIEM agent will picking up and dealing with they are inside XML view

### Now Let's Dive into Practical Example.

as an analyst i want to see the logon attempts that will happen on my PC either success and failure

First thing i have to know what Information Gets Written, to know if it configured or not, these are the sources the logs getting written from

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/X4nNSUC.png)

as I said I want to know the logon attempts so from prev photo i should go to Local Security Policy and search for logon service to configure it to audit the logon attempts:

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/3jQDrja.png)
it is not configured so i have to configure it: right-click on it then properties

first let's navigate to explain section to see what is does 
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/BQmi0CT.png)
it allows me to audit all events that are belong to logon attempts on the computer... 
that what we're looking for, next thing is to configure it on success and failure attempts from policy section.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/LQsmvHe.png)

mark this 2 options to audit success and failure and now let's try to login

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/wvU14hB.png)

there are no logs yet now i will lock my pc and try to login but i will type wrong password 1 time to see the both success and failure logs.

![](https://i.imgur.com/U0FT0rS.png)

now i got a lot of logs 

**Note: success and failure each of them has a unique EventID that you can use it to get all the events related to them**

1. Successful Login Event ID = 4624
2. Failure Login Event ID = 4625

you can read more about Event IDS [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/appendix-l--events-to-monitor)

now i can use 4625 to see the failure login attempts.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/GPB7g9d.png)

i got 1 log after filtering the logs which includes these details
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/Hcn0INA.png)

Failure Reason: is reason that happened to make the process failed like in login i typed wrong password, take a look at all the highlighted texts and understand it well.

now time to see the success log details using this event id: 4624

i got many more logs but we will depend on the time

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/GoaYIvD.png)

If you noticed i highlighted common thing between them something called: **Logon Type: 5 or 2**

what is the logon type then: **the type of logon which was performed. The table below contains the list of possible values for this field.**

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/gZkGlfH.png)

**I Will Leave to You the Last pane discover it by yourself and now let's move to something else**

## Windows Defender Events
This an example for windows defender when i ran a malicious file on my pc and i was enable real-time protection windows defender made an alert and log this event you can see windows defender logs from

Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Windows Defender > Operational

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/SSqVYkQ.png)

## BONUS
if you arrived here, i want to tell you good job you made a big progress :D

Last thing in this topic about `Get-WinEvent` PowerShell Command

If you want to get Details For Specific Event ID you can use the following commands:

    $logs = Get-WinEvent -ListProvider Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing 

then:

    $logs.events | where-object {$_.id -eq EVENT_ID} | fl *

 -- Don't Forget to Replace EVENT_ID with the event id that you want to data about.
