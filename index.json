[{"content":"Hey folks, Today I will talk about: How We Can Monitor\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Dive in!!\nFirst of all Monitoring has 2 main types:\nEndpoints\nNetwork\nso what is the different between them and what data can I see from them.\nlet\u0026rsquo;s start with Network Monitoring:\nNetwork First we have to put some Questions to answer.\nDo you know which ports are actually in use? Which services are actually being used on those ports? Do you know which domains are being visited and by who? Can you detect malicious encrypted traffic? Can you see high-level bandwidth and traffic flow? You Should be noticed we\u0026rsquo;re talking about network analyze.\nSo how do we get the answer?\nHere comes NSM\u0026rsquo;s role and it stands for Network Security Monitoring\nWhat is Network Security Monitoring? Network security monitoring is an automated process that monitors network devices and traffic for security vulnerabilities, threats, and suspicious activities also it involves collecting and analyzing data, which in turn give companies the opportunity to detect and respond to intruders in their network.\nwe can basically say with Network Security Monitoring we can know\nWho is talking to Who what they are saying and what type of service they are actually using.\nWhat are the benefits of (NSM)? Analyzing network traffic.\nServices: DNS, HTTP(S), SMB, RDP, FTP, SSH, etc.\nIdentifying risky / compromise-like behavior\nExploit Delivery Internal recon and pivoting Command \u0026amp; Control (C2) Traffic Data Exfiltration Executable content transfer NSM By Layer Layer 3 \u0026amp; 4\nNetFlow, Firewall Logs, Statistical Data Layer 7\nService Logs Packet Capture, IDS alerts NSM Event Collection Points and Formats Why we need NSM? You can read this article Link\nEndpoints Also with Endpoints Monitoring we should put some Questions to answer.\nThe Questions Are:\nHas anyone installed unauthorized program? What Ports are listening and why? What exploits are you vulnerable to? Have any system files been changed? Have any malicious scripts been run.? You should be noticed we\u0026rsquo;re talking about Computers, Clouds, Servers\nSo how do we get the answer?\nHere comes CSM\u0026rsquo;s role and it stands for Continuous Security Monitoring or you can call it ISCM as NIST definition, so what is it?\nWhat is the Continuous Security Monitoring? Continuous Security Monitoring (CSM) is a strategy that automates the process of continuously checking and evaluating your operational security. The idea behind this approach is to enable you to identify vulnerabilities and fix them before cybercriminals exploit them.\nAlso you can read the Definition of NIST\nWhat are the benefits of CSM? it is looking at endpoint data \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;data at rest\u0026rdquo; or the data being generated on the endpoint Provides real-time visibility into your applications and infrastructure Vulnerability scanning File/Registry integrity monitoring Autoruns Services Running process Classifies devices: to allow you to implement preventive measures CSM Event Collection Here are the CSM Event Collection Sources:\nOS/Application auth logs Sysmon Antivirus EDR Whitelisting HIDS/HIPS Vulnerability Scanner How Does CSM Work? Continuous monitoring solutions work by providing real-time information about an organization\u0026rsquo;s security posture. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology\u0026rsquo;s white paper NIST SP 800-137, information security continuous monitoring (ISCM) works by\nMaintaining situational awareness of all systems across the organization and its vendor ecosystem Maintaining an understanding of threats and threat activities Assessing all security controls Collecting, correlating, and analyzing security-related information Providing actionable communication of security status across all tiers of the organization; and Active management of risk by organizational officials. Integration of information security and risk management frameworks. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework breaks down the entire process into the following core components:\nIdentification Protection Detection Response Recovery Why we need CSM? Investigations will require network \u0026amp; endpoint data\nFor Example: Malware Infection occurs\nTraffic is generated to an IP on port 443\nWhile investigation with network data maybe you will see the bad IP or the bad domain for example..?\nbut what if you know that these processes created it now you see the process tree calc.exe | PID: 2092 and this calc.exe start cmd.exe of course this is not looking good? now we identified that this a persistence technique also now we know where is the file on the drive.

They help you track what happened and troubleshoot problems.\nEvent Viewer The Windows Event Logs are not text files that can be viewed using a text editor. However, the data are XML-formatted .evtx files and they stored in C:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs\n- Note: File must be interpreted with tool - Cannot read directly like linux log text files There are 3 main ways of accessing these event logs within a Windows system:\nEvent Viewer (GUI-based application) Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool) Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet) i will explain Event Viewer and Get-WinEvent, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about event viewer first\nwe can open it using windows search and type event viewer or you can right-click on windows icon and select event viewer or we can use CLI and type eventvwr.msc\nso after open event viewer we will see the following:\nEvent Viewer has an intuitive user interface. The main screen is divided into three sections:\nThe pane on the left provides a hierarchical tree listing of the event log providers and they called ( channels ). The pane in the middle will either display a general overview and summary or the events specific to a selected channel. The pane on the right is the actions pane. 1- Channels Pane The Channels pane is where you choose the event log to view. By default, there are five channels of Windows logs More info Microsoft :\nApplication – Information logged by applications hosted on the local machine.\nSecurity – Information related to login attempts (success and failure), elevated privileges, and other audited events.\nSetup – Messages generated when installing and upgrading the Windows operating system. If the Windows system is a domain controller, those messages are also logged here.\nSystem – Messages generated by the Windows operating system.\nForwarded Events – Events forwarded by other computers when the local machine is functioning as a central subscriber.\nThere is also a section for Applications and Services Logs, including channels for Hardware Events, Internet Explorer and Windows PowerShell events, windows defender events..etc, you better take a look by yourself.\nactually these channels are files they are .evtx files stored in your system you can try to read them by right-clicking on any channel then choose properties you will see all the details about the channel\nOne other thing you should know before dive into next pane, What is the Windows Log Path?\nFrom prev photo we noticed that there is something in the middle called Windows Event Log Service, this the service that allowed the windows to record all your logs so if you want to know if it enabled or no you can check it by typing Services in windows search and navigate to windows event log and you should see the following\nif you noticed it is enabled by default and in the left the description of the service and what it does,\nafter gets the data will filter the data based on their channels and we have discussed the channels\u0026hellip; for example: found a logon attempt so it will put the log in the security channel because this channel is holding the logon attempts success and failure and so on\u0026hellip; Let\u0026rsquo;s Continue\n2- Detail pane There are 5 types of events that can be logged. Below is a table from docs.microsoft.com providing a brief description for each.\nEach event has a type Level:\nFocus your attention on the middle pane. Remember from earlier that this pane will display the events specific to a selected provider In this case, Security Channel.\nselect security channel.\nThis section has 2 tabs: General and Details.\nGeneral is the default view, and the rendered data is displayed. The Details view has 2 options: Friendly view and XML view. in XML view this what the log actually looks like, and if you want to see the real fields that your SIEM agent will picking up and dealing with they are inside XML view\nNow Let\u0026rsquo;s Dive into Practical Example. as an analyst i want to see the logon attempts that will happen on my PC either success and failure\nFirst thing i have to know what Information Gets Written, to know if it configured or not, these are the sources the logs getting written from\nas I said I want to know the logon attempts so from prev photo i should go to Local Security Policy and search for logon service to configure it to audit the logon attempts:\nit is not configured so i have to configure it: right-click on it then properties\nfirst let\u0026rsquo;s navigate to explain section to see what is does it allows me to audit all events that are belong to logon attempts on the computer\u0026hellip; that what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for, next thing is to configure it on success and failure attempts from policy section.\nmark this 2 options to audit success and failure and now let\u0026rsquo;s try to login\nthere are no logs yet now i will lock my pc and try to login but i will type wrong password 1 time to see the both success and failure logs.\nnow i got a lot of logs\nNote: success and failure each of them has a unique EventID that you can use it to get all the events related to them\nthis a list of Microsoft Event IDS Microsoft\nEvent ID Potential Criticality Event Summary 4624 Low An account was successfully logged on. 4625 Low An account failed to log on. now i can use 4625 to see the failure login attempts.\ni got 1 log after filtering the logs which includes these details Failure Reason: is reason that happened to make the process failed like in login i typed wrong password, take a look at all the highlighted texts and understand it well.\nnow time to see the success log details using this event id: 4624\ni got many more logs but we will depend on the time\nIf you noticed i highlighted common thing between them something called: Logon Type: 5 or 2\nwhat is the logon type then: the type of logon which was performed. The table below contains the list of possible values for this field.\nI Will Leave to You the Last pane discover it by yourself and now let\u0026rsquo;s move to something else\nNew Scheduled Task Event ID: 4698 Event ID Potential Criticality Event Summary 4698 Low A scheduled task was created. 4699 Low A scheduled task was deleted. 4700 Low A scheduled task was enabled. 4701 Low A scheduled task was disabled. 4702 Low A scheduled task was updated. Service Creation: Windows Event ID 7045 Actually this Event ID is not listed in Microsoft Events ID but Service Creation is another way the attackers use for persistence or use the computer resources for mining cryptocurrency\nUSB Plug \u0026amp; Play: Event ID 6416 In order to track if there is any devices that plugged in into your PC follow those steps:\n1- Enable the USB Logging option by accessing the Event Viewer:\nBy going to Local Security Policy read the explain first to know what is does and then enable success and failure\nnow back to event viewr and use the Event ID\nWindows Defender: Event IDs 1006 / 1116 This an example for windows defender when i ran a malicious file on my pc and i was enable real-time protection windows defender made an alert and log this event you can see windows defender logs from\nApplications and Services Logs \u0026gt; Microsoft \u0026gt; Windows \u0026gt; Windows Defender \u0026gt; Operational\nPowerShell Logs: Windows Event ID 4104 So First we need to turn audit policy on by follow those steps:\n1- go to edit group policy \u0026gt; Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; Windows PowerShell\n2- we will pick Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging\nthen turn it on like this\nafter this back to event viewer and navigate to Applications and Services Logs \u0026gt; Microsoft \u0026gt; Windows \u0026gt; PowerShell \u0026gt; Operational to see the logs, once you opened the powershell and filter the logs by its event id yo\u0026rsquo;ll notice that there is a log has fade in it tells you powershell opened\nthen write any command in my case i will use whoami\nBONUS if you arrived here, i want to tell you good job you made a big progress :D\nLast thing in this topic about Get-WinEvent PowerShell Command\nIf you want to get Details For Specific Event ID you can use the following commands:\n$logs = Get-WinEvent -ListProvider Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing then:\n$logs.events | where-object {$_.id -eq EVENT_ID} | fl * \u0026ndash; Don\u0026rsquo;t Forget to Replace EVENT_ID with the event id that you want to get data about.\nChannels of Interest for the analyst Mapping ATT\u0026amp;CK to Windows Event IDs Indicators of attack (IOA) uses security operations to identify risks and map them to the most appropriate attack.

Several malware programs exfiltrate the stolen information to an attacker-controlled SMTP server. For example Agent Tesla is a Windows-based keylogger and Remote Access Trojan (RAT) commonly uses SMTP to exfiltrate stolen data.\nAttackers can use the following PowerShell code to send an email with an attached file (stolen data) to exfiltrate a remote address:\nStream Exfiltrate via DNS Since DNS is not a transport protocol, many organizations don\u0026rsquo;t regularly monitor the DNS protocol! The DNS protocol is allowed in almost all firewalls in any organization network. For those reasons, threat actors prefer using the DNS protocol to hide their communications.\nThe DNS protocol has limitations that need to be taken into consideration, which are as follows,\nThe maximum length of the Fully Qualified FQDN domain name (including .separators) is 255 characters. The subdomain name (label) length must not exceed 63 characters (not including .com, .net, etc). Based on these limitations, we can use a limited number of characters to transfer data over the domain name. If we have a large file, 10 MB for example, it may need more than 50000 DNS requests to transfer the file completely. Therefore, it will be noisy traffic and easy to notice and detect.\nThe attacker registers the domain name ZG5ZC2VJDXJPDHKK.COM, and sets up name server NS1.ZG5ZC2VJDXJPDHKK.COM The infected client encodes stolen information, in this case, the text Pa$$w0rd, into UGEKJHCWCMQK The client makes the DNS query for the domain with the encoded password as a subdomain: UGEKJHCWCMQK.ZG5ZC2VJDXJPDHKK.COM A recursive name server finds the authoritative name server NS1.ZG5ZC2VJDXJPDHKK.COM and sends the query there. The attacker recognizes the subdomain value as the encoded password. The attacker decodes the information UGEKJHCWCMQK back to recover Pa$$w0rd Diagram: Then the attacker receives the encoded data and decode it to get the sensitive data.\nExfiltrate via DNS Tunneling DNS tunneling is a difficult-to-detect attack that routes DNS requests to the attacker\u0026rsquo;s server, providing attackers a covert command and control channel, and data exfiltration path.\nThe Client has a Firewall, IDS and proxies that are inspecting and blocking the susp traffic so how can they move the data?\nYes, they will abuse the DNS Protocol to create a covert channel and exfiltrate the sensitive data out.\nSo How this works:\nThe Attacker established a domain with local DNS Server. Attacker Will try to query his DNS server from the client machine so what happens is when the client tries and goes to this website it will passed through local DNS and this DNS Server probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the IP Address of the attacker\u0026rsquo;s website so it will query this website and ask for the IP Address of it and the website will respond with the IP Address. since the queries are just packets so the attacker can manipulate it the attacker puts the sensitive data into the query and send it splitted so he won\u0026rsquo;t get caught. and finally attacker receive it and reconstruct it and get his sensitive data Exfiltrate via IPv6 shows the ‘IPv6teal receiver script’ running on the attacker-controlled machine; it is trying to listen and capture the targeted data: You Will Find More Examples: exfiltration-attacks Detecting Data Exfiltration so we are talking about transferring data so first thing is to check the volume of the data that being transfer over your network\nMonitor High-Volume DNS tunneling or High-Volume Traffic being from unusual source but it is not should be 100% with high-volume.\na connection to unknown destination (C2) maybe\nAlso, you have to check Process Creation Logs, maybe they compressed archive especially from CLI with password or 7z, WinRAR\nPay attention to DLP, UEBA alerts the following file types to bypass DLP so take care:\nPlain Zip Password protected (AES) Zip Deeply nested Zips (many systems will stop scanning after 10-100 to avoid Zip Bombs) 7zip RAR CAB Tar (+/- gzip) WIM image check multiple port firewall denies outbound from a single source\nComplex URLs or Unexplained URLs with long parameters\n1 http://ooo.nu6tgnzvgm2tmmbzgq4a.rkgo---redacted---tw5.5z5i6fjnugmxfowy.beevish.com/xml.php?c=0\u0026amp;t=x\u0026amp;k=.txt\u0026amp;type=0\u0026amp;s=3500\u0026amp;n=example.txt They use Complex URLs to exfiltrate they data just to make you a bit blind or confused about the URL you will think a safe URL with params just like Microsoft URLs it has a long parameters but in fact they maybe carrying out some data\nMonitoring for outbound traffic patterns:- as malware needs to regularly communicate with C2 servers to maintain a consistent connection. Continuous monitoring provides opportunities to detect data exfiltration with common protocols such as HTTP:80 or HTTPS:443. It’s worth keeping in mind that some advanced malware randomize delays between C2 communications.\nKeeping an up-to-date log of all approved IP addresses connections to compare against all new connections: Along with this, it’s advised to keep an eye out for large data flows to unexpected IP addresses and major spikes in anomalous outbound traffic.\nBlock unauthorized communication channels: First, disable all unauthorized communication channels, ports and protocols by default, and re-enable on an as-needed basis.\nData Loss Prevention (DLP): Data loss prevention (DLP) is a strategy for detecting and preventing data exfiltration or data destruction. Many DLP solutions analyze network traffic and internal \u0026ldquo;endpoint\u0026rdquo; devices to identify the leakage or loss of confidential information. Organizations use DLP to protect their confidential business information and personally identifiable information (PII), which helps them stay compliant with industry and data privacy regulations.\nResources I used for this Article:\nattack.mitre.org blog.apnic.net www.sans.org \u0026ndash; Thanks For Reading.\n","permalink":"https://1nk0x01.github.io/write-ups/soc-tips/data-exfiltration/","summary":"Hey folks, Today we will talk about how to Spot Data Exfiltration\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Dive in!!\nFirst of all we should know what is data exfiltration. according to MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK® Data Exfiltration is the Step when The adversary is trying to steal data may use to steal data from your network.\nThis could be done over Web Service, over USB, over Cloud Storage, Emails and many more, you can read more about it Resource","title":"Spotting Data Exfiltration"},{"content":" Challenge Name: Bus\nPoints: 150\nThe Challenge was a [ PCAP File ], hmm don\u0026rsquo;t like to analyze these types but it\u0026rsquo;s okay let\u0026rsquo;s dive in!\nFirst thing let\u0026rsquo;s open it in Wireshark and see the traffic.\nas usual messy traffic xd, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at traffic that look at modbus protocol there’s nothing interesting in this protocol except the Data section.\ni displayed them as a Column to make things more clear to me\nData are ff00 or 0000 0000 is represents 0 and ff00 represents 1 Like Signals\nso i used tshark to extract all the Data\ntshark -r bus.pcap -T fields -e modbus.data -Y \u0026ldquo;modbus.data != 0 and tcp.dstport == 502\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; bus.txt\nby replacing every 0000 and ff00 to there 0 and 1 value i got the following\n011110010110111101110101011100100010000001000110010011000100000101000111001000000110100101110011001110100010000001001101011011110110010001100010011101010111001101011111011010010111001101011111011001010110000101110011011110010101111101100001011001100111010001100101011100100101111101100001011011000110110000100001 Great!, it\u0026rsquo;s a binary data, convert it CyberChef .\nFlag: BlackHatMEA{Modbus_is_easy_after_all!}\nThanks For Reading\n","permalink":"https://1nk0x01.github.io/write-ups/blackhatmea/forensics/bus/","summary":"Challenge Name: Bus\nPoints: 150\nThe Challenge was a [ PCAP File ], hmm don\u0026rsquo;t like to analyze these types but it\u0026rsquo;s okay let\u0026rsquo;s dive in!\nFirst thing let\u0026rsquo;s open it in Wireshark and see the traffic.\nas usual messy traffic xd, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at traffic that look at modbus protocol there’s nothing interesting in this protocol except the Data section.\ni displayed them as a Column to make things more clear to me","title":"BlackHatMEA | Bus"},{"content":" Challenge Name: Mem\nPoints: 250\nThe Challenge was a [ RAW file ],\nit is a memory dump file, so our hero for this chall will be [ Volatility ]\nFirst thing as usual let\u0026rsquo;s start with the basic vol command\nbut i use vol3 so maybe you will notice the command is not like yours\nnothing useful i know but it just our routine while analyzing :D\nso our desc is saying that we are looking for a file, hmm let\u0026rsquo;s fire a scan for all the files\ni have extracted it and it is has a flag.txt but protected with a password\nso this what desc said about it we need this password to get our flag\nafter doin some analyze on the memory, process i noticed that the challenge said password stored locally so let\u0026rsquo;s dive into windows.envars\nby the following command\npython3 vol.py -f ../mem.raw windows.envars.Envars \u0026gt; vars.txt 300 csrss.exe 0x2e1930 SystemP Ittm1Fc7hcuFrLZIQmxs Bingo!
